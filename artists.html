<p>Influential Artists...</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Literature</h2>
    <p>Mark Twain: Today he is best remembered as the author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). Twain is widely considered one of the greatest American writers of all time.
    </p>


<p> Jane Austen: Jane Austen was an outspoken critic and commentator at a time when the patriarchy was very much still in full swing. Her books explore how women sought out marriage in order to achieve social standing and financial stability and is seen today as something of a 19th century feminist.

    <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
    <p>Leonardo Da Vinci: Leonardo da Vinci achieved legendary status in his time as a painter and his contributions to visual art echoes to this day. It is almost impossible to discuss painting without mentioning the great Renaissance artist known as Leonardo Da Vinci. Leonardo was a versatile artist as he was great at painting sculpture and a long list of other artworks. Leonardo’s accomplishments transcend visual art as he is regarded as a genius in many other fields. He was known for many incredible paintings which were mostly for nobles and churches. From frescos to wall paintings to architecture, Leonardo Da Vinci displayed a heightened level of mastery over all of his crafts.

    <p>Frida Kahlo: Know for creating self-portraits, Frida Kahlo is one of the most influential visual artists of her time born in 1907, she created many impressive artworks that were based on nature and artifacts. This Mexican artist created many impressive works which included The Broken Column, a painting which focused on the injuries she sustained in a fatal auto crash.

  <h2>Graphic Arts</h2>
    <p>Paula Scher: Paula Scher was the first woman to sit in a principal position at the acclaimed graphic design firm Pentagram, and for good reason. Her impressive body of design shaped the perception and application of graphic design in many ways, particularly her technique of treating type as a visual image in her work for the New York City’s Public Theater (pictured above) which continues to have a lasting impression on modern design.
    </p>

<p> David Carson: Appropriately dubbed ‘the Godfather of Grunge’, David Carson revolutionized the design industry by taking a unique, rule-breaking attitude toward design. His strikingly shredded, warped, and sometimes illegible layout designs remain to be a constant source of radical inspiration for designers around the globe.

<h2>Plastic Arts</h2>
  <p>While he's associated closely with fresco art due to his impressive Sistine Chapel ceiling, Michelangelo is really a sculptor at heart. He believed that every block of marble contained a work of art waiting to be released, and he just needed to chip away until it appeared. His iconic David statue remains an enduring symbol of the Italian Renaissance and continues to inspire generations of artists. A sculptor until his dying day, Michelangelo was dedicated to his craft, and he continued working right up until the week of his death at the age of 88.

<p> Constantin Brancusi: One of the most influential sculptors of the 20th century, Constantin Brancusi was a pioneer of Modernism. The Romanian artist was greatly influenced by folk traditions, though he also sought inspiration in cultures outside of Europe. His sculptures are known for their clean, geometric lines, as evidenced by his acclaimed Bird in Space series. Brancusi also created masterful outdoor sculpture. Endless Column is one of three works he created to commemorate Romanian heroes of World War I. The stacked shapes feature a half rhomboid at the top of the totem, which is meant to symbolize infinity.

<h2>Decorative Arts</h2>
  <p>Tamara de Lempicka: PTamara de Lempicka is possibly one of the most admired and most recognizable Art Deco artists. Born in Poland in 1898 and settling in Paris after the Russian revolution, Lempicka became engaged in the bohemian lifestyle of 1920s Parisian socialites, painting portraits of many prominent figures including the exiled nobility, which brought the painter critical acclaim, fame, and considerable wealth. Her artistry is a perfect representation of her lifestyle of glamour. Drawing inspiration from the popular painting movements of the time like cubism, for instance, Tamara de Lempicka developed her unique approach, which was more subtle than the original cubist expression, elegant, precise and clean.
</p>
<p> René Lalique: ARené Jules Lalique is probably the world’s most famous glass art designer whose legacy is still strong today and whose pieces are favored by the collectors. Born in 1860 in Paris, Lalique became one of the most praised Art Nouveau jewelry designers working for the leading French jewelers like Cartier and Boucheron. In 1920s René Lalique abandoned his Art Nouveau orientation toward natural, free-flowing forms and adopted the tendencies of the emerging Art Deco art style. His pieces became more streamlined and he began experimenting with new materials from metal to enamel.

<h2>Performing Arts</h2>
  <p>Adrian Piper: Active during the American Civil Rights movement, Piper’s works explore racial and cultural bias. In one series of public performances—which she advertised in advance in New York’s Village Voice—the artist took to the streets dressed as a mustachioed African-American man with a large Afro and engaging in stereotypical masculine behavior.
    </p>
<p> Martha Wilson: “As women, we find ourselves performing all the time to meet society and the culture’s expectations about what we’re supposed to do, how we’re supposed to look, what we’re supposed to think,” Wilson explained in a 2015 interview. Her work dissects these issues of gender identity and beauty ideals: In video and photographic performance pieces, the chameleonic Wilson transforms herself into a drag queen, traditional housewife, lesbian, and a series of American first ladies.

<h2>Music</h2>
  <p>Bob Marley: After his breakthrough in 1973, Jamaican-born singer Bob Marley became a household name, imbuing reggae with rock-star allure and a magnetic stage presence. Proving that reggae was about more than a series of novelty hits, Marley ensured his place as one of the most influential musicians of all time by elevating the genre to a space where it received both critical and commercial acclaim. His Rastafarian-inspired lyrics espoused a humanitarian, easy-going worldview that made him a global icon for peace.
    </p>
<p> David Bowie: Nobody changed music as much as art rock chameleon David Bowie. A master provocateur confronting sexual conformity with his androgynous looks, Bowie’s ingenious personas (glam rock alien Ziggy Stardust, the steely nobility of the Thin White Duke) led the way in inspiring others to meld fashion, theatre and performance art with popular music.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>Frank Lloyd Wright: Wright revolutionize 20th-century architect, and his midwestern upbringing played a crucial role in shaping his sensibility. Inspired by the low-lying building that dotted the American plains, Wright created the Prairie House style as a reaction the prevailing Victorian aesthetic, which emphasized dark decor, and busy embellishments both inside and out.
    </p>
<p> Renzo Piano: Unlike other architects on this list, Italian architect Renzo Piano isn’t recognized for having a singular style. Instead, his building have been eclectic, ranging from the Neo-Brutalism of his design for the Whitney Museum’s home in the Meatpacking District, to the elegant, light-filled Menil Collection in Houston Texas, which resembles an overgrown version of a mid-century house by West Coast modernist, Richard Neutra.
