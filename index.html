      <p>Art is for everyone. From children to adults, a creative outlet is important for self-expression. For children, art projects can help in self-discovery. Analyzing the way a child's brain works versus an adult can help adults understand their children better. Art for adults could help with reconnecting with your inner child or your true self. Learning what works for you and what doesn't helps with problem solving. We each have qualities that make us unique. With these unique qualities comes the opportunity to express oneself through the creation of art. Expressing yourself through art helps reduce anxiety and depression, as well as helps with self-discovery which provides a healthy mind, body and spirit.
