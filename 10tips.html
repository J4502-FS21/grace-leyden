    <h2>Daily Expression:</h2>
    <p> Whether you just had a long day at work or school, setting time aside for yourself to express your creativity (in any form) is helpful. This allows for you to reconnect with yourself and get the juices flowing. It can also help reduce stress after a long day. The art doesn’t have to be significant, as it can just be a couple doodles.

    <h2>Out with the old, in with the new</h2>
    <p>Treat yourself to new supplies. This may inspire you to work on your art more often.
    </p>

<br>

  <h2>Make Mistakes</h2>
    <p> Art isn’t perfect and neither are you. It’s important to remember this when making mistakes because it is not necessarily a bad thing. The best way to learn and become better is to make mistakes.
</p>

<br>
  <h2>Be Intuitive</h2>
    <p> Not every part of your art has to be perfect. Over-analyzing your art can create a block in creativity and a negative response.
